# Wide-ResNet
# Mini-Project 1: Residual Network Design (ECE GY 7123, NYU Tandon, Spring 2022)

This repository contains an implementation of ResNet (Residual Networks) architecture to classify the images in CIFAR-10 dataset. The constraint on the network is that the number of parameters should be less than 5M. With this constraint, the parameters are tuned with a goal to achieve maximum possible accuracy.

## Usage
This code can be run by running "project1_model.py" on the command line or by running the code in a jupyter notebook.

## Results
This model gives an accuarcy of 94.23% on cifar10 dataset.
