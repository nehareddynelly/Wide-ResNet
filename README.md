# Wide-ResNet
# Mini-Project 1: Residual Network Design (ECE GY 7123, NYU Tandon, Spring 2022)

This repository contains an implementation of ResNet (Residual Networks) architecture to classify the images in CIFAR-10 dataset. The constraint on the network is that the number of parameters should be less than 5M. With this constraint, the parameters are tuned with a goal to achieve maximum possible accuracy.

## Usage
You can run the pspurce.py.py file either using vscode with a local vscode installation or on Google Colab without the need to install any additional software

## Results
This repository contains a ResNet model to classify images which has an accuarcy of 94.23%
